# The Paintbrush

Small keyboard designs for those who cannot or prefer not use 'traditional' keyboard designs.

*This project aims to create keyboard designs that are adaptable and flexible. Especially for those with disabilities, those who cannot type on traditional keyboads and those that prefer not use traditional keyboards.*

## What

A collection of open hardware designs that can be built free of charge for non-commercial use. These designs are meant to be used with systems like [ARTSEY.IO](https://www.artsey.io/), [ASETNIOP](http://asetniop.com/) and others.

We also work to have our hardware designs supported by well known open source keyboard firmware projects to make it easier to setup and use these designs.

## Why

There are few keyboard options for those with hand disabilities. The few commercial keyboards 'designed' to address hand disabilities are incredibly expensive and aren't well designed if you consider risk of long term RSI related problems. This project was founded to address these systemic issues.

## Who

The founder has had their left hand immobilized for 6 weeks and their right hand injured badly enough to cause typing problems on traditional keyboards for 2 weeks.
