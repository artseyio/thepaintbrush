# The Paintbrush

A small keyboard design for those who cannot or prefer not use 'traditional' keyboard designs.

*This project aims to create a small keyboard design that is adaptable and flexible. Especially for those with disabilities, those who cannot type on traditional keyboads and those that prefer not use traditional keyboards.*

The current version of The Painbrush is [version 4](/hardware/v4).

## What

A small keyboard hardware design that can be built free of charge for non-commercial use. The design is meant to be used with systems like [ARTSEY.IO](https://www.artsey.io/).

We also work to have our hardware supported by well known open source keyboard firmware projects to make them easier to setup and use.

## Why

There are few keyboard options for those with hand disabilities. The few commercial keyboards 'designed' to address hand disabilities are incredibly expensive and aren't well designed if you consider risk of long term RSI related problems. This project was founded to address these systemic issues.

## Who

Just a human who has had their left hand immobilized for 6 weeks and their right hand injured badly enough to cause typing problems on traditional keyboards for 2 weeks.
